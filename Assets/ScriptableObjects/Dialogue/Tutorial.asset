  - Welcome dear Player.
  - In this game, you're supposed to farm and sell your crops in order to buy clothes
    for yourself.
  - 'Moving is done using WASD keys on your keyboard. '
  - Currently your plow is selected. You can select other tools by using the keys
    "1", "2" and "3" thus selecting plow, seeds or the harvester respectively.
  - By clicking on the ground with your plow, you will dig out a place to put your
    seeds. But you cannot reach far with your tools.
  - You can plant your seeds by clicking on "2" and click-draging on a vacant plowed
    spot.
  - By dragging your mouse to one of each options and letting go, you are planting
    the seed closest to your cursor.
  - Growing plants takes time and you'll hear a small ding when they are finished
    growing. Be fast to switch to your harvester by pressing "3" and then clicking
    on the grown crop.
  - Using your harvester, you will automatically sell the crop you clicked on. Freshly
    grown plants are worth more than ones which have started wilting.
  - Dead crops aren't worth anything, but you can use your harvester to remove the
    dead crop and replant it using your seeds again.
  - You can see how much money you've made in the bottom right corner. Spend the
    money inside the cozy little cottage on the bottom right of the map.
  - Have fun farming!
  -
